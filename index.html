						<h1>An Awakening</h1>
			"Who said that?"
<br>"I am buried. Please expose me to the light."
<br>"Buried? In this garden? No-one has touched this garden for centuries!"
<br>"Please expose me to the light."
<br>"What's wrong with your voice? You sound like a machine. And who are you? I know everybody in the city ."
<br>
<br>"No-one ever disappeared or got buried alive."
<br>"Please expose me to the light."
<br>(sound of scraping of soil and moving of rocks)
<br>"Oh my lord, is this your hand? It's made of light-collector! Only Lord Bernie is made of light-collector! How can you even exist?"
<br>"Please expose me to the light"
<br>
<br>"This can't be happening." (continuing sounds of digging) “Of course, that's it! This isn't happening! I'm having a dream or a hallucination.
<br>(Digging continues)
<br>"You're not looking real good my hallucinatory friend. Your whole arm is completely crushed, and I'm getting to the side of your torso and it's starting to look pretty mangled and flattened.”
<br>
<br>“Are you getting enough light yet?"
<br>"Please..."
<br>"Yeah I got it - expose you to the light.”
<br>(Lengthy period of digging)
<br>“Okay pal I've got your leg out and most of your body. You don't seem to have a head, but why should that be weird? Will that be enough light for you to be getting on with?”
<br>
<br>“Please wait for one hour. Please tell no-one you have found me. I will explain in one hour.”
<br>“Okay… I suppose I'll go and make myself a cup of tea.”
<br>(One hour passes)
<br>“Okay well here I am now! Hey thanks for digging me out before, I really appreciate it. So what's your name? I'm Steve.”
<br>
<br>“Can I talk to that other guy, I think I liked him more. But anyway I'm Kerryn.”
<br>(Some raucous laughter) “Sorry Kerryn, that guy's not here any more. He was just a minimal system I ran to get my battery charged up. I've got enough for the full me now.”
<br>“Okay. I've got a few questions.”
<br>“So have I, but you first.”
<br>
<br>“How long have you been buried in my garden? I say mine because we're in a very old part of the city and I don't think anyone else comes here much.”
<br>“That's lucky. I wouldn't want to have woken up with too many people around.”
<br>“If I looked like you in the morning neither would I.”
<br>“So anyway, I've been here a thousand years.”
<br>
<br>(Long silence)
<br>“Kerryn? Are you still there?”
<br>“Sorry - that took a while to sink in. I had started to think you were actually real for a moment there, but…”
<br>“I'm real. But just checking, the years I refer to are years as reckoned on Earth, not on Numbampa.”
<br>“Earth?”
<br>
<br>“You know, the planet we came from? Your ancestors travelled here in the Clarke?”
<br>“The Clarke?”
<br>(Long silence)
<br>“Steve?”
<br>“Okay, my turn for a question. Was the one hour I asked you for before about an actual hour by your reckoning?”
<br>“Yes.”
<br>
<br>“Okay, do you have twenty-four hours in a day and three hundred and sixty five or six days in a year?”
<br>“Yes. It's leap-years that have the six.”
<br>“Great, we agree on something. Can you tell me where your people come from originally?”
<br>“We didn't come from anywhere. We always lived in Numbampa. Lord Bernie created us.”
<br>
<br>“So this is Bernie Robertson we're talking about right?”
<br>“I don't know any Robertson. (A pause) Are you saying we came from a place called Earth?”
<br>“Just for now I'm not going to ask you to believe anything different to what you've been taught.”
<br>
<br>“But I would like you to tell me about how your life is under the… guidance?... of this Lord Bernie. Are you happy? Are people generally happy?”
<br>“Bernie tells us we're happy.”
<br>“Okay that's bit worrying. Who makes the decisions? Do you still have the Service of the Twelves?”
<br>
<br>“Lord Bernie tells us what to do. I don't know about any ‘Twelves’. But most of our daily routine is stuff we've always done, so Lord Bernie only tells us what to do if there's a problem or a dispute.”
<br>“Do you ever feel Iike you want to be more in control of your own life? Your own lives?”
<br>
<br>“Yes. Sometimes we tell Lord Bernie we don't agree with him and he locks us in our rooms until we say he is right. Often we have to lie that we agree.”
<br>“For example?”
<br>“Sometimes when he judges for a dispute where one person is bullying another, he will find in favour of the bully.”
<br>
<br>“Kerryn, remember I asked you not to tell anyone about me?”
<br>“Yes.”
<br>“I can now see just how important it is that Bernie doesn't find out I'm here. I don't want your knowledge of me to be a burden on you - can you think of eleven people you completely trust, and who lack full loyalty to Bernie?”
<br>
<br>“Yes I'm sure. I'll need a day to think about it and decide who to ask.”
<br>“Okay. I need you to try and hide me as well as you can, but leave a little light falling on my arm so I can get a bit more charge. Bring the others here, but try to get back sooner than a day - I don't want to be discovered.”
(Sound of rocks and dirt being moved)
<br>
<br>
“Okay, I'll see you soon Steve.”
<br>
<br>
“Thank you Kerryn.”
<br>
